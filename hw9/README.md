C. Description:
   My website is a personal website, showcasing my skills, experience, and other information about myself. The website is engaging, with an animation that begins as soon as the page loads. Additionally, there are several links to external websites that provide more information or context, allowing the user to engage even with plain blocks of text. There is also an animation that makes text slowly appear on the screen when the page is changed, so the transitions are not so harsh and sudden.
   There are multiple ways to navigate through the website. There is a scrolling option, where each page of information follows the next when scrolling, and there is also a navigation bar at the top that can be clicked to jump to specific pages. For the scrolling option, I implemented full-page scrolling, so each page is viewed fully and individually, so users focus only on one thing at a time. The navigation bar moves with the user's scrolling, so it is conveniently placed if needed.
   My main goal was to keep the website clean and simple, while also implementing features that make it easier/more fun to use. To make my design accessible, I used larger font sizes with sharply contrasting colors and large buttons that are easy to see and select. Additionally, to accommodate for visual impairments related to color, I used colors from a palette that is designed to be colorblind-friendly.
   The target audience is mostly employers. As I build up a portfolio, I plan on adding pieces to my website to display them in a convenient and user-friendly way. Currently, I have some links that route to different projects and repositories, but some of these links are generic due to certain class policies.

D. Using the Website:
   - Begin at the home page and scroll to view all the pages (they are ordered: home->about me->education->work experience->projects->contact)
   - Begin on any page and use the navigation bar at the top to view any individual page (education, work experience, projects, contact)
   - Begin on a clicked page (pages that were rached using the navigation bar) and click the AG button in the top left corner to go back to the home page
   - Click on any links to navigate to the relevant associated website. Links are indicated by underlines, and on the about page, underlines appear only when hovering over a link

E. External Libraries:
   I used animations in my project, and implemented my own version of a suggested library. I chose animations, because I wanted to create interesting effects using more basic tools to gain a deeper understanding of their possibilities and limits. Additionally, in my assignment 7 feedback, fullPage.js was a library suggested to me and I liked the idea, but did not want to pay to use it. I used css and javascript to create animations on my home page and each page that is reached from the navigation bar. These include a typing effect and an effect where the text fades onto the page when appearing. Also, instead of using fullPage.js, which is a library that supports scrolling by each page (rather than a continuous scroll), I implemented this feature myself by using html and css code. The animations add both a fun/interesting effect to my website, as well as make page transitions less sharp/harsh so it is more aesthetically pleasing. The full page scrolling effect adds to my website in that I am able to have a seamless scrolling experience while still ensuring that users are not overwhelmed by multiple sets of information presented all at once.

F. Iteration from HW7:
   I changed my design a little bit from Homework 7, because at the time I was not completely sure of what animations or features to include. The biggest change from homework 7 to my final prototype is the scrolling function. I initially planned for each page to only be accessible from the top navigation bar, but added the additional 'endless' scrolling option to create a more seamless experience. I implemented full-page scrolling, so each page is viewed individually as if it would have appeared from the navigation bar even while scrolling.

G. Major Challenges:
   I did not face any insurmountable challenges during this project, but did have some major challenges. The biggest challenge I faced was when I had to go back and change working code that I had already written, because it had to be altered to accommodate new features. While we learned early on in the class not to put design features off for later, I ended up deciding to add the 'harder' parts later and focused on getting the basics done first. This ended with me having to change large amounts of code that were previously finished and functional, which took a lot of time and energy.
